The study of extreme rainfall events through the construction of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves is of great importance for water resource management and drainage basin systems design. This report focuses on creating IDF curves for extreme precipitation in Costa Rica, through the use of extreme value theory and deep learning. Bivariate and multivariate analyzes with non-stationary max-stable processes are used to quantify the joint probability of extreme rainfall at multiple sites, along with a regionalization approach based on hierarchical clustering to decompose the territory into regions with similar behaviours with respect to extreme events. This study highlights regions with strong seasonality and a clear demarcation between the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, especially for extreme precipitation events that extend over long periods. The use of machine learning tools allowed to model the local effects and the different weather systems present in Costa Rica.
